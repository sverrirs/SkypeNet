What is this:
-----------------------------------------------
A .NET 4 implementation of the Skype Desktop API. 
Provides a native C# way of communicating with a 
running instance of the Skype application.

Based off previous work done by Gabriel Szabo and published on CodeProject in 2006
including a bug fix proposed by user Vlad0 to that same project on 19 Sep 2007
